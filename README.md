## Requirements

The requirements for TIM can be installed in a separate conda environment by running the following command in your terminal: `conda env create -f environment.yml`. You can then activate this with `conda activate TIM`.

**NOTE:** This environment only applies to the `recognition` and `detection` folders. Seperate requirements are listed for the backbones in the `feature_extractors` folder.

## Features

The features used for this project can be extracted by following the instructions in the `feature_extractors` folder.

## Pre-trained models

You can find links to the relevant pre-trained models in the recognition, feature_extractors and detection folders.

## Ground-Truth

We provide the necessary ground-truth files for all datasets [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xs6muwf67a5h9ql30jart/annotations.zip?rlkey=iw6b4w9n4brcpvygoksmrvf4n&st=j6c1exut&dl=0).

The link contains a zip containing ground truth data for each dataset, consisting of:

- The training split ground truth
- The validation split ground truth
- The video metadata of the dataset
- The feature time intervals for training and valdiation splits

**NOTE:** These annotation files have been altered to be compatible with the TIM codebase.

## Training and Evaluating TIM

We provide instructions on how to train and evaluate TIM for both recognition and detection in the respective folders.
